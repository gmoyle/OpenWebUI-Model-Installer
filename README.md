## FAQ

### **Q: Do I need to manually install Docker?**
- **A**: No, the script will automatically install Docker if it's not already installed. For Windows, it uses **Chocolatey** to install Docker Desktop, and for macOS, it uses **Homebrew**.

### **Q: What if I don‚Äôt have **WSL2** (Windows Only)?**
- **A**: If **WSL2** is not installed, the script will automatically install it for you.

### **Q: What happens if I run the script without administrator rights?**
- **A**: If you don't run the script as **Administrator** on Windows, it will prompt you to do so. On macOS, you‚Äôll be asked to use `sudo` if necessary.

### **Q: Can I change the default model used by **Ollama**?**
- **A**: Yes, the installation script detects your available memory and will prompt you to select the best model for your system. You can also modify the `docker-compose.yml` file manually for custom configurations.
